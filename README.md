# domoticz-scipts
Here I'm sharing some of my home automation scripts for Domoticz running on a Raspberry Pi, written in python and lua.

## python scripts

### dzcom.py
This package provides some classes and functions to communicate with Domoticz using its [JSON API URL][1].

### teleinfo.py
This package provides a class that reads the information transmitted by an electric counter using the *teleinfo* protocol.  
This protocol is used on french electric couters. It's specification can be found in [this][2] document.  

## lua scripts
Coming soon...
